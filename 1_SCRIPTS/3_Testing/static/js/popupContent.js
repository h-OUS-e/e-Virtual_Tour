    bodyText: "Through i2A's proprietary integration program, Sage has blended two of the most advanced clinical diagnostic tools with its i2A application suite creating an interactive patient triage platform powered by Pearl Second Opinion Software and Pearl Practice Intelligence. <br><br> By merging conventional X-rays with Pearl's AI engine, Sage can identify missed or worsening pathology and new disease states in real-time prior to even stepping foot in the patient treatment room. These aren't X-rays - they are Intelligent X-rays. <br><br> Sage has integrated this data into the VISION platform, allowing office managers and clinicians to prepare for patients and identify potential treatment before the patient even enters the office.  For the first time, Sage dentists can evaluate disease progression over the last two years automatically, leading to a more immediate call to action on the part of the patient and deepening patient trust.",
